<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Don't say a word. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? What, I don't get what happened. Breakfast. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

<p>Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. I, I don't know. I can't play.

<p>That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Actually, people call me Marty. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.
